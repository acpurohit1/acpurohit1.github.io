	<h2> speakeasies </h2>
	All of these are fantastic. Super small and usually hard to get in, but don't give up! They're worth the effort.
	<br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Knee High Stocking Company (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Sit at the bar if you can, bartenders are extremely skilled and fun to watch. Text ahead to make reservations <br> 
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Needle & Thread (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Speakeasy within Tavern Law. 1920s decor with waiters in costume. Call head for reservations and enter by picking up the payphone in the bar below <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Bathtub Gin (Belltown) </span> <br>
	Tiny speakeasy located in a back alley. Darkly lit and intimate, excellent cocktails  <br>
	<br>

	<h2> bars </h2>
	A mix of louder bars for a night out and intimate ones where you can hear yourself talk
	<br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Still Liquor (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Quieter, hidden bar. A couple tables, good for bigger groups looking for a chill night <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Unicorn (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Macklemore filmed his music video here. Quirky bar with interesting drinks, arcade games on bottom level <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Linda's (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Fun, casual, divey. Check out the back outdoor patio and claim a spot near the heater <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Pine Box (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	A converted funeral home, you can still see the pews and hearse entrance. Huge beer selection <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Rumba (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	200+ rums, small, dark, loud <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Capitol Cider (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Head to lower level for dozens of ciders (rhubarb, pear, peach!) and boardgames! <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Rhein Haus (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Previously Von Trapps, this German bar sells German food (mediocre) and includes indoor bocce ball lanes (awesome!) <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Barca (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	The most lounge-y bar in Cap Hill. Dark, loud, crowded, and a fun stop for a Cap Hill bar crawl <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Grimm's </span> <br>
	Butterfly Lounge is awesome, but ridiculously long entry line - pass on this one <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Hopvine Pub (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Hosts one of the longest running open-mic nights Wednesdays at 8:30 (and where I performed in my first one!) Great crowd, excellent performers <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Canon (Central District) </span> <br>
	The largest spirits collection on the Western Hemisphere, renowned worldwide <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Hideout (First Hill) </span> <br>
	Good for sitting and talking with friends. Lots of (creepy) conversation-starting paintings on the wall<br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Zig Zag (Downtown) </span> <br>
	Near Pike Place market, hip and quirky, and known to make a mean old fashioned <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Clever Bottle (Belltown) </span> <br>
	Cozy, relaxed vibe, very wooden/rustic inside. Love this place <br>
	<br>

	<h2>dance clubs </h2>
	Seattle's club scene is severely limited, so if you want to go clubbing you'll probably end up at one of these.
	<br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Foundation (Belltown) </span> <br>
	EDM lovers unite here <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Aston Manor (Industrial District) </span> <br>
	Top 40 + EDM. High energy, good music, and fun crowd <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Trinity (Pioneer Square) </span> <br>
	Different rooms with different music (Top 40, EDM). Mixed reviews among friends but usually a fun night <br>
	<br>
	<span class="title"> Havana (Capitol Hill) </span> <br>
	Sketchy from outside (entrance is behind deserted building) but always busy inside. Thursdays are Soul Night! <br>
